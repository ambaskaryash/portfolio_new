**Live Demo:  [Portfolio - Yash](https://yash-portfolio2022.vercel.app/)**

Hi! In this project I try to develop a calculator app with **Vue, Typescript, Pinia, Vite**.

If you want to try it out you can simply click **Code > Copy Icon** and go to your Terminal/Cmd etc.

    git clone THIS_REPOSITORY_LINK

After cloning is finished, you **must** install the npm in order to run.

    npm install

Then, you are ready to give it a shot! Just type

    npm run-script dev  

and you will see the project in your browser!
